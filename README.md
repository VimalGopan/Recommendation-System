# 🛍️ Product Recommendation System

A machine learning-powered recommendation engine that suggests products based on user ratings using **collaborative filtering** (SVD). Built with **Python**, **Flask**, **HTML/CSS/JS**, and real-world e-commerce data.

## 📌 Features

- 🔄 Random product selector
- ✅ Recommendations based on user-product interaction
- 💡 Collaborative filtering via Truncated SVD
- 🖥️ Interactive UI using HTML/CSS and JavaScript
- ⚙️ Flask-based backend
- 📊 Product names mapped dynamically with ID

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Loaded and cleaned 20k+ user ratings
   - Mapped product IDs to meaningful names
   - Created a utility matrix (User vs Product)

2. **Model**  
   - Applied Truncated SVD for matrix decomposition
   - Built a product-product similarity matrix using correlation

3. **Web App (Flask)**  
   - Random product grid UI
   - Recommend products with >90% similarity
   - Dynamic UI interaction (highlight, recommendation list)
